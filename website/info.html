            <p class="text-red">yfBETA restructures the DeFi narrative to reward tokenholders. Yield is great, but how does it add value to tokenholders?</p>
            <hr>
            <p>yfBETA uses yields generated from farming other protocols. When you stake your assets on yfBETA, in addition to farming yfBETA, the assets will be used to farm the highest performing assets from other protocols, leaving yfBETA strategies to do the hardwork whilst you farm more yfBETA. Rather than distributing these rewards to farmers, they are used to buy and burn yfBETA in the market, reducing the supply of yfBETA. </p>

            <h2>Mechanics</h2>
            <p>Say on day 1 the highest-performing asset and ecosystem is Compound DAI, with 14.3% APR - the smart contract buys DAI for ETH on Uniswap, then interacts with Compound’s smart contract and allocates the capital to their DAI. On day 4, the highest-performing asset changes to Aave USDC - the smart contract reallocates the funds from Compound to the contract, then Uniswap to exchange – on-chain - the DAI for USDC, then invests it on Aave. Repeat as necessary!</p>
            <p>The yield generated from holding these assets are paid in-kind on the highest-yielding platform. Every night at 00:00 UTC, the smart contract calculates the daily yield, exchanges half of it for the underlying asset and withdraws it from the lending platform. It then converts to ETH on Uniswap, and buys the liquidity on Uniswap for yfBETA with whatever ETH it’s accumulated. The other half is left on the platform and reinvested into yfBETA holdings, creating a growth in the capital that compounds over time.</p>
            <p>This Buy n Burn mechanic also has the added value of directly increasing the token price. Where normal burn processes leave it to the markets to apply a new price to the tokens burned - through supply and demand - a Buy N Burn actually raises the value as tokens are bought from the market from the lowest sellers. This immediately increases token price for all holders.</p>
            <p>How does it compare? Say we all have 1m tokens total, and we each have ~10k tokens. If we burn 1% from everyone then we all have 1% less, increasing price by 1%.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>But net net that's equal to what individual tokenholders had before, in value</h2>
            <p>if the smart contract buys n burns 1%, then the sellers at the market have 1% less and have more eth - and everyone else has a higher % of the token supply, which is now worth more at market.</p>
            <p>This means that as time goes on, the value of holding tokens increases - as, over time, yfBETA is compounding it’s capital by reinvesting half of the proceeds back into the ecosystem. This means that there’s more burn and more increased value for tokenholders the longer they hold.</p>
            <p>All of these numbers are variable and change day by day, minute by minute. The only certainties are that the ecosystem will outperform any given DeFi that it indexes, as it’s constantly changing the investment to the best-performing possibility, and that the token’s supply will be reduced - at an increasing rate over time - which will directly increase the price as the burn’s value in Ether are executed on tokens available at a liquid market.</p>
